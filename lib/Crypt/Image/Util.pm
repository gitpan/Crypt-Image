=head1 DESCRIPTION

Utility module for Crypt::Image. Methods can be accessed directly.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 cloneImage()

It clone the given image (object of type GD::Image) and returns the clone of type
GD::Image.

=cut

sub cloneImage {
    my ($image) = @_;

    return $image->clone;
}

=head2 saveImage()

Saves the given image data as given file  name  of the given type. The parameters
are listed below in sequence:

=over 3

=item * Filename with the complete path.

=item * Object of type GD::Image for the image.

=item * Type of the given image.

=back

=cut

sub saveImage {
    my ($file, $image, $type) = @_;

    open(IMAGE, ">$file");
    binmode IMAGE;
    print IMAGE $image->png  if $type =~ /png/i;
    print IMAGE $image->gif  if $type =~ /gif/i;
    print IMAGE $image->jpeg if $type =~ /jpg/i;
    close(IMAGE);
}

=head2 moveDown()

Moves the given pixel down by given number.

=cut

sub moveDown {
    my ($this, $by) = @_;

    ($this < 128)?($this += $by):($this -= $by);
    return $this;
}

=head2 moveUp()

Moves the given pixel up by given number.

=cut

sub moveUp {
    my ($this, $by) = @_;

    ($this >= 128)?($this -= $by):($this += $by);
    return $this;
}

=head2 getColor()

Returns the color index for the given R, G and B.

=cut

sub getColor {
    my ($r, $g, $b) = @_;

    my $image = GD::Image->new();
    return $image->colorAllocate($r, $g, $b);
}

=head2 splitInTwo()

It  splits  the  given  point into X, Y coordinates and returns an object of type
Crypt::Image::Axis.

=cut

sub splitInTwo {
    my ($a) = @_;

    my $r = int(random_uniform() * $a);
    $a -= $r;
    return Crypt::Image::Axis->new('x' => $a, 'y' => $r);
}

=head2 splitInThree()

It splits the given point into X, Y, Z coordinates  and returns an object of type
L<Crypt::Image::Axis>.

=cut

sub splitInThree {
    my ($a) = @_;

    my $z = 0;
    my $r = int(random_uniform() * $a);
    $a -= $r;
    if ($a > $r) {
        $z = int(random_uniform() * $a);
        $a -= $z;
    }
    else {
        $z = int(random_uniform() * $r);
        $r -= $z;
    }

    return Crypt::Image::Axis->new('x' => $a, 'y' => $r, 'z' => $z);
}

=head2 differenceInAxis()

It returns the absolute difference in the R, G and B of the given  key and cloned
images at X and Y coordinates. The parameters are listed below in sequence:

=over 4

=item * Object of type GD::Image for key image.

=item * Object of type GD::Image for new image.

=item * X coordinate.

=item * Y coordinate.

=back

=cut

sub differenceInAxis {
    my ($k, $c, $x, $y) = @_;

    my ($k_r, $k_g, $k_b) = Crypt::Image::Util::getPixelColorRGB($k, $x, $y);
    my ($c_r, $c_g, $c_b) = Crypt::Image::Util::getPixelColorRGB($c, $x, $y);

    return (abs($k_r-$c_r), abs($k_g-$c_g), abs($k_b-$c_b));
}

=head2 getPixelColorRGB()

Returns the R,G,B of the given image at the given X,Y coordinates. The parameters
are listed below in sequence:

=over 3

=item * Object of type GD::Image for the image.

=item * X coordinate.

=item * Y coordinate.

=back

=cut

sub getPixelColorRGB {
    my ($image, $x, $y) = @_;

    my $index = $image->getPixel($x, $y);
    my ($r, $g, $b) = $image->rgb($index);
    return ($r, $g, $b);
}
